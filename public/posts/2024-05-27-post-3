I have a problem. Florida flagfish are one of the most prolific hair algae eaters i have seen. However the guy at the fish store told me they are doscile and can be housed with bettas. With this information i added him to my algae infested tank along with my beta and chili rasboras. It made quick work of the hair algae, but two days later i witnissed that fish take a bite out of my betta's fin, it went for another boty attack before i removed the betta from the tank. THe betta was alright, but i had to move it to my shrimp tank. Over the last few weeks it has killed my thriving aquarium shrimp colony. Thanks alot guy from aqua imports.
